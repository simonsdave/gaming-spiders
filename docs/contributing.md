# Contributing

The following instructions describe how you can contribute
to this project.

## Getting Started

See [this](../dev_env) for details of how to configure a development environment
and get the automated tests working.

## Branching and Versioning Strategy

* all development is done on the ```master``` branch
* we use [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/)
* for each release a new branch is created from master called ```release-<version>```

## How To Cut a Release

* this process leverages all the good work in from the [simonsdave / dev-env](https://github.com/simonsdave/dev-env) project
* the shell script ```prep-for-release-python.sh``` automates much of the release process
* make sure your ```~/.pypirc``` is setup

```bash
(env) ~/gaming-spiders> pip install ndg-httpsclient
```

```bash
(env) ~/gaming-spiders> prep-for-release-python.sh
